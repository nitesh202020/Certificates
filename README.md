Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are a rich framework for
encoding probability distributions over complex domains: joint
(multivariate) distributions over large numbers of random variables
that interact with each other. These representations sit at the
intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts
from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and
more.
